The preprocessing module in IEEE PAMI 2013: A Framework for Automatic Modeling from Point Cloud Data


Structures the unstructured LiDAR data captured using an airborne scanner, into memory-manageable components which can be further processed in parallel. 

The size of the "tiles" or "geospatial bounding boxes" can be adjusted by changing the preprocessor flags: RES_x, RES_Y, RES_Z.
